# Important Notice: Open Source Learning Project

This project is a personal learning initiative and not a commercial product. Through its development, I gained valuable insights into:

- Token management in AI systems
- Agent-to-agent communication patterns
- Implementation of hierarchical AI architectures
- Practical applications of LLM-based systems

<aside>
This project is freely available to anyone interested in implementing it using Flowise and the provided JSON document. Feel free to use, modify, and learn from it!

</aside>

The primary goal of sharing this project is to:

- Contribute to the open-source community
- Help others learn about AI agent architectures
- Demonstrate practical applications of NIST frameworks
- Share insights about token optimization and agent relationships

While this implementation shows promise, it's important to note that it's primarily an educational project meant for learning and experimentation rather than production use.

# NIST SP 800-30 AI Risk Assessment Assistant

## Framework Selection Rationale

NIST SP 800-30 was chosen as the primary framework for training our AI Agents due to several key advantages:

- Rich tabular data structure ideal for AI training and pattern recognition
- Open-source nature allowing unrestricted access and implementation
- Comprehensive risk assessment matrices that provide clear decision-making guidelines
- Well-structured control catalogs that can be easily parsed by AI systems

## Implementation Methodology

The system incorporates:

- FRAME Analysis methodology focusing on asset value and liability assessment
- Integration with FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) principles
- Mock data generation using ChatGPT for testing and demonstration
- Modular architecture allowing for easy integration with real ITSM systems

## Important Notes and Limitations

<aside>
- Model accuracy varies and estimates may change between iterations
- Further refinement is needed for specific use cases
- Current implementation uses mock data; real ITSM integration would provide more accurate results

</aside>

## Future Improvements

The ideal implementation would include:

- Direct integration with enterprise ITSM systems via API
- Real-time asset inventory updates
- Custom risk scoring based on actual organizational data

## Alternative Asset Valuation Strategy

When traditional monetary valuation proves challenging, consider implementing a multi-faceted approach:

- Utilize web search APIs to gather market data about similar systems and industry standards
- Implement an automated scoring system based on:
    - System criticality (primary/secondary/tertiary)
    - Public exposure level
    - Data sensitivity classification
    - Operational impact of system failure

The AI agent can be configured to:

- Cross-reference discovered assets against public databases for similar deployments
- Calculate replacement costs based on current market rates
- Estimate potential revenue impact from system downtime
- Factor in regulatory compliance requirements and potential penalty costs

<aside>
Remember that automated valuations should be reviewed by domain experts and adjusted based on organization-specific contexts.

Consider implementing a hybrid approach where the AI agent provides initial valuations based on public data, which are then refined through human expert review.

To implement this valuation approach effectively, a specialized Sequential Valuation Agent (SVA) would need to be added to the system architecture. This agent would:

- Generate initial asset valuations based on collected data and market research
- Present these values to users for review and adjustment
- Store approved valuations in a structured format
- Trigger the Risk Assessment Assistant once all valuations are confirmed

<aside>
This sequential process ensures that risk assessments are based on accurate, human-verified asset values while maintaining automation efficiency.
