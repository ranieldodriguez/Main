A velocity chart is used in agile project management to track the amount of work completed in each iteration (sprint). It measures the team's capacity for work by comparing the estimated effort (story points) against the actual effort.

**Pros**: Provides insight into team productivity. 
          Helps in predicting future performance. 
          Aids in sprint planning and backlog refinement.

**Cons**: Can be misleading if the team's estimates are inaccurate. 
          Does not account for external factors impacting team performance.

**Special Features**: Tracks actual vs. planned progress. Provides a clear visual of team's performance trends over time.

A scatter chart (or scatter plot) displays values for typically two variables for a set of data. The data is displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis.

**Pros**: Shows the relationship between two variables.
Helps identify trends, correlations, and outliers.

**Cons**: Can become cluttered with too much data.
Does not show causality, only correlation.

**Special Features**: Useful for identifying patterns or clusters in data.
Can be enhanced with trend lines to show direction and strength of relationships.
