# NIST SP 800-30 AI Risk Assessment Assistant

## Framework Selection Rationale

NIST SP 800-30 was chosen as the primary framework for training our AI Agents due to several key advantages:

- Rich tabular data structure ideal for AI training and pattern recognition
- Open-source nature allowing unrestricted access and implementation
- Comprehensive risk assessment matrices that provide clear decision-making guidelines
- Well-structured control catalogs that can be easily parsed by AI systems

## Implementation Methodology

The system incorporates:

- FRAME Analysis methodology focusing on asset value and liability assessment
- Integration with FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) principles
- Mock data generation using ChatGPT for testing and demonstration
- Modular architecture allowing for easy integration with real ITSM systems

## Important Notes and Limitations

<aside>
- Model accuracy varies and estimates may change between iterations
- Further refinement is needed for specific use cases
- Current implementation uses mock data; real ITSM integration would provide more accurate results

</aside>

## Future Improvements

The ideal implementation would include:

- Direct integration with enterprise ITSM systems via API
- Real-time asset inventory updates
- Custom risk scoring based on actual organizational data
