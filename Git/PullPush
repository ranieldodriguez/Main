To pull a repository from GitHub to your local machine and push changes from your local machine back to GitHub, you'll need to follow these steps:
  Pulling a Repository from GitHub
  Clone the Repository: This will download a copy of the repository to your local machine.
  sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
  Replace https://github.com/username/repository.git with the URL of your repository.

  Navigate to the Repository Directory: After cloning, move into the repository directory.
  sh
  cd repository
  Making Changes and Pushing to GitHub

Make Changes: Make changes to the files in your repository using your preferred editor (e.g., VS Code).
  Check the Status: See what changes have been made.
  sh
  git status

  Add Changes: Add the changes to the staging area.
  sh
  git add .
  This command stages all changes. If you want to stage specific files, replace . with the file names.

  Commit Changes: Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.
  sh
  git commit -m "Your commit message"

  Push Changes: Push the committed changes to the GitHub repository.
  sh
  git push origin main
  Replace main with the branch name if you are working on a different branch.

Pulling Changes from GitHub to Local Repository
  Fetch Changes: This will update your local repository with changes from the remote repository without modifying your working directory.
  sh
  git fetch

  Merge Changes: This will merge the fetched changes into your working directory.
  sh
  git merge origin/main
  Replace main with the branch name if you are working on a different branch.

  Pull Changes: You can also use the git pull command, which is a combination of git fetch and git merge.
  sh
  git pull origin main
  Replace main with the branch name if you are working on a different branch.

  Select "Your repositories" from the dropdown menu.
  Click on the repository you just pushed your changes to.
  View the Changes:
  Once you are in your repository, you will see the main page of the repository, which typically displays the files and folders in the repository.
  The most recent commit message should be displayed at the top of the file list.
  Inspect Commits:
  To see a list of all commits, click on the "Commits" link, which is usually found above the file list and below the repository name and description.
  This will show you a history of all the commits, including your most recent one.
  Click on the commit message to see the changes made in that commit.
  Check Specific Files:
  You can click on individual files in the repository to view their contents.
  This will reflect the latest changes you pushed from VS Code.

Steps to Pull Changes from GitHub to Your Local Repository
  Open Terminal or Git CMD:
