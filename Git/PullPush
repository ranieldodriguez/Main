To pull a repository from GitHub to your local machine and push changes from your local machine back to GitHub, you'll need to follow these steps:
  Pulling a Repository from GitHub
  Clone the Repository: This will download a copy of the repository to your local machine.
  sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
  Replace https://github.com/username/repository.git with the URL of your repository.

  Navigate to the Repository Directory: After cloning, move into the repository directory.
  sh
  cd repository
  Making Changes and Pushing to GitHub

Make Changes: Make changes to the files in your repository using your preferred editor (e.g., VS Code).
  Check the Status: See what changes have been made.
  sh
  git status

  Add Changes: Add the changes to the staging area.
  sh
  git add .
  This command stages all changes. If you want to stage specific files, replace . with the file names.

  Commit Changes: Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.
  sh
  git commit -m "Your commit message"

  Push Changes: Push the committed changes to the GitHub repository.
  sh
  git push origin main
  Replace main with the branch name if you are working on a different branch.

Pulling Changes from GitHub to Local Repository
  Fetch Changes: This will update your local repository with changes from the remote repository without modifying your working directory.
  sh
  git fetch

  Merge Changes: This will merge the fetched changes into your working directory.
  sh
  git merge origin/main
  Replace main with the branch name if you are working on a different branch.

  Pull Changes: You can also use the git pull command, which is a combination of git fetch and git merge.
  sh
  git pull origin main
  Replace main with the branch name if you are working on a different branch.
