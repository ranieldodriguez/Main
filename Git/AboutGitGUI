The Git GUI provides a graphical interface for interacting with Git repositories. Here’s an overview of the elements you mentioned and how to use them:
  Current Branch: Main
  Current Branch: Indicates the branch you are currently working on. In this case, it's main. You can switch branches or create new ones from here.
  Unstaged Changes
  Unstaged Changes: This section lists all the files that have been modified but not yet staged for commit. These changes are tracked by Git but are not part of the commit snapshot.
  Staged Changes
  Staged Changes: This section lists all the files that have been added to the staging area. These changes are ready to be committed to the repository.
  Rescan
  Rescan: This button refreshes the view to reflect the current state of your working directory. It updates the lists of unstaged and staged changes.
  Stage Changed
  Stage Changed: This button stages all the currently unstaged changes. Staging a file means it’s marked to be included in the next commit.
  Sign Off
  Sign Off: Adds a Signed-off-by line to your commit message. This is often used to indicate that the committer agrees to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), which is a statement that you have the right to submit the changes and that you are willing to have your work incorporated into the project.
  Commit
  Commit: This button commits the staged changes to the repository. When you click it, a dialog will appear asking for a commit message. The commit message should describe the changes you have made.
  Push
  Push: This button pushes your committed changes to a remote repository, such as GitHub. You need to specify the remote repository and branch if they are not already configured.
  Amend Last Commit
  Amend Last Commit: This allows you to modify the most recent commit. You can add new changes to it or change the commit message. This is useful if you realize you forgot to include something in your last commit or made a mistake in the commit message.
  Using Git GUI

Here’s a typical workflow using the Git GUI:
  Check Unstaged Changes: Look at the list of unstaged changes to see which files have been modified.
  Stage Changes: Select the files you want to include in your next commit and click Stage Changed to move them to the staged changes area.
  Commit Changes: Once you have all the changes you want to commit in the staged area, click Commit. Enter a descriptive commit message and finalize the commit.
  Push Changes: After committing, click Push to send your changes to the remote repository. This ensures your changes are backed up and shared with others if you're collaborating.
  Amend Last Commit: If you need to make changes to your last commit, use the Amend Last Commit option to adjust the commit message or add more changes to it.
  Additional Tips
  Navigating Branches: You can create, switch, and manage branches through the Git GUI. This is helpful for managing different lines of development.
  Pulling Changes: Make sure to regularly pull changes from the remote repository to keep your local copy up to date with others’ work.
  Resolving Conflicts: If there are conflicts when merging or pulling changes, the Git GUI can help you visualize and resolve them.
