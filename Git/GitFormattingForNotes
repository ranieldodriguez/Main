Inserting images into a GitHub document, such as a Markdown file, is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:
  Step-by-Step Guide:
  Upload the Image to GitHub:
    Navigate to the repository where you want to add the image.
    Click on the Upload files button or drag and drop your image file into the repository.
  Get the Image URL:
    After the image is uploaded, navigate to the image file in your repository.
    Click on the image file to open it, then right-click on the image and select Copy image address or Copy link address.
  Insert the Image in Your Markdown File:
    Open the Markdown file where you want to insert the image.
    Use the following Markdown syntax to insert the image:

Markdown is widely used for formatting readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
