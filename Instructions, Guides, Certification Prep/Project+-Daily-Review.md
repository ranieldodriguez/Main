# **Velocity Chart**

![Velocity Chart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18c7e949-f864-489b-9062-931474da2b9c)

A velocity chart is used in agile project management to track the amount of work completed in each iteration (sprint). It measures the team's capacity for work by comparing the estimated effort (story points) against the actual effort.

**Pros**: Provides insight into team productivity. 
          Helps in predicting future performance. 
          Aids in sprint planning and backlog refinement.

**Cons**: Can be misleading if the team's estimates are inaccurate. 
          Does not account for external factors impacting team performance.

**Special Features**: Tracks actual vs. planned progress. Provides a clear visual of team's performance trends over time.

# **Scatter Chart**

![Scatter Chart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d613870e-7a2f-4308-955f-cb58ddb51936)

A scatter chart (or scatter plot) displays values for typically two variables for a set of data. The data is displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis.

**Pros**: Shows the relationship between two variables.
Helps identify trends, correlations, and outliers.

**Cons**: Can become cluttered with too much data.
Does not show causality, only correlation.

**Special Features**: Useful for identifying patterns or clusters in data.
Can be enhanced with trend lines to show direction and strength of relationships.

# **RACI Chart**

![RACI Chart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38ab5da6-24ec-44b9-968a-b7ff257ba2e7)

A RACI chart (Responsibility Assignment Matrix) is a tool used to clarify roles and responsibilities in a project. RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.

Responsible: The person or people who are directly responsible for doing the work or task. They are the ones who complete the task or produce the deliverable. There should typically be at least one person assigned to this role to ensure accountability.

Accountable: The person who is ultimately answerable for the completion of the task or deliverable. This person ensures that the task is completed satisfactorily and signs off on the work. There should be only one accountable person for each task to avoid confusion.

Consulted: The people or groups whose opinions are sought. They provide input, feedback, and advice based on their expertise or stake in the task. These individuals or groups are involved in two-way communication.

Informed: The people or groups who need to be kept updated on the progress or outcomes of the task. They are typically not involved in the work itself but need to be aware of its progress and results. Communication with them is usually one-way.

**Pros**: Clearly defines roles and responsibilities.
Helps avoid confusion and overlaps.
Enhances communication and accountability.

**Cons**: Can be complex to set up for large projects.
Might require regular updates as project roles change.

**Special Features**: Provides a clear, at-a-glance view of who is responsible for what.
Facilitates better project governance and stakeholder management.

# **PDM Chart**

PDM or Precedence Diagram Method is a visual representation of a project's activities and their dependencies. It is commonly used in project scheduling.

**Pros**: Clarifies the sequence of project activities.
Helps in identifying critical path and dependencies.
Enhances understanding of project flow.

**Cons**: Can be complex for large projects.
Requires regular updates as project progresses.

**Special Features**: Utilizes nodes to represent activities and arrows to show dependencies.
Aids in identifying and managing critical activities.

# **Run Chart**

![Run Chart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/460ecbf0-c3e6-413d-816e-4cd0585c0a21)

A run chart is a line graph that displays data points in a time sequence, showing trends and patterns over a period.

**Pros**:Simple and easy to create.
Helps in identifying trends, shifts, and cycles.
Useful for monitoring processes over time.

**Cons**: Does not show the cause of variations.
Limited in showing multiple variables.

**Special Features**: Highlights trends and variations in data over time.
Can indicate process stability and predict future performance.

# **Gantt Chart**

![Gant Chart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cfee70b-4b32-4e7e-8a58-c59654585325)

A Gantt chart is a bar chart that represents a project schedule. It shows the start and finish dates of the project elements.

**Pros**: Provides a clear visual timeline of project activities.
Easy to understand and communicate.
Helps in tracking project progress.

**Cons**: Can become unwieldy for very complex projects.
Requires updates to remain useful.

**Special Features**: Visualizes task durations, dependencies, and milestones.
Enables project managers to monitor progress and manage resources effectively.

# **CPM Chart**

![CPM Chart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0644066a-0190-4474-a5b2-d7528a3a0ddb)

CPM is a project modeling technique that identifies the longest sequence of tasks in a project, which determines the shortest possible project duration.

**Pros**: Identifies critical tasks that must be completed on time.
Helps in prioritizing project activities.
Assists in resource allocation and risk management.

**Cons**: Can be complex to manage and update.
Not suitable for projects with high variability in task durations.

**Special Features**: Highlights the critical path and float for non-critical tasks.
Provides a clear view of project timelines and dependencies.

# **Pareto Chart**

![Pareto Chart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df3ea976-603f-4820-a3a6-12be76dfd6e4)

A Pareto chart is a type of bar chart that represents the frequency or impact of problems or causes in a process, showing them in descending order.

**Pros**: Highlights the most significant factors in a dataset.
Helps in prioritizing problem-solving efforts.
Easy to interpret and use.

**Cons**: Does not show causality, only the relative frequency or impact.
May oversimplify complex issues.

**Special Features**: Combines bar and line graphs to show the cumulative impact.
Useful for identifying the "vital few" from the "trivial many."
