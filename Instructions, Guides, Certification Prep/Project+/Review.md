# Whiteboard:
collaboration tools that is the most effective for creating visual representations, brainstorming, and collectively discussing solutions
# Difference between Agile and Waterfall methodologies:
Waterfall follows a sequential and linear approach, progressing through distinct phases in a predifined order. 
Agile on the other hand, emphasizes iterative and incremental development, enabling flexibility and customer collaboraiton throughout the project.
# Simulation
Form of quantitive risk analysis that requires probability distributions for each outcome to make predictions. Detectability is a considerations in qualitive risk analysis. It measures how quickley a risk can be identified if it occurs.
# Qualitive Risk Anlysis
USes subjective criteria to anlayze and prioritize risks. It is faster and more intuitive thant quantitative risk analysis becuase it uses characteristics such as severity, likelyhood, and urgency and descriptors like high, medium, and low to catergorize and prioritize risks rather than mathematical formulas.
# Project Kick off Meeting
A live meeting that usually takes palce after the initiation phase of a project. The meeting brings together the project team members and helps to foster a shared understanding of the project.
# Burnup charts
Show the amount of work completed in the time period, with a line indicating the target for completed work. At the start of the project, the line begins at zero and ends at the total amount of work needed for completion. The progress is emasured toward the total, moving up as work is completed. Burnup charts work well for projects with a fixed scope and flexible timeline.
# Background screening
Operational security measure.
# Smoke Test
High-level system test that confirms that the main features of the software are working before detailed testing is conducted. It helps detect flawed builds early, saving time and effort.
# Qualitive Risk Analysis
Subjective approach to analyzing risk. It relies on individual preception and interpretation of risks, using basic scales to evaluate them. It serves as a preliminary step in risk management. Two main considerations in qualitative analysis are interconnectivity and detectability. Interconnectivity analyzes how risks may interact with one another, potentially causing a ripple effect. Detectability measures how quickly a risk can be identified if it occurs. High detectability risks offer clear signals, while low detectability risks may go unnoticed.
# Business Case
Argument for the project's existence. It should be compelling, appealing, and easy to read. It serves as the first project proposal and is completed during the planning phase.
# Agile-based methodologies
SAFe, XP, and Scrum are Agile methodologies
# Risk Exploitation
Involves taking steps to ensure that the event uccurs. It is the opposite of risk avoidance.
# Stakeholder ID
Determining who the stakeholders are is necessary for project managers as the first step in developing a stakeholder plan. Stakeholders include anyone who will be impacted by the project. Knowing who they are will help keep them up to date with progress, which helps reduce resitance to change. Determining who the stakehodlers are is done during the initiation phase. 
# Test Enviroment
a tier of software architecture where the beta version of the code is put before developers and even sample users to help find and resolve issues before launch.
# Client TOR (Terms of Reference)
Similar to SOW (Statement of Work), but often focuses on a relationship rather than the deliverables. TORs are common when dealing with consultants. 
# Facilitate the Transition
The third step in creating systemic Organizational Change Management (OCM). It should involve training and lots of support from within the company.
# Units of Work
UOW result from the project being decomposed into small units, which can be completed in the sprint or other chosen work periods. They are defined during the planning phase. 
# SOW (Statement of Work)
Provides details about what work the vendor must complete. It defines the scope, sets expectations, and outlines technical requirements for the work. Vendors use the SOW to determine whether they can deliver the work. The SOW is produced early in the project and is included as part of the RFP (Request for Proposal). It is important that the SOW be clear, comprehensive, and concise. 
# Issue vs Defect
An issue is something that is outside of the team's control. A defect is a failure to meet the requirements. The failure can be remedied by either changing the product or changing the requirements.
# The options
A section that explores three to five potential solutions, providing advantages and disadvantages of each. Doing nothing should be only one option offered.
# Confidential data
Sensitive and should be seen only by authorized individuals whose jobs require the information. This can cinlude profit and loss statements and other information that a company might want to keep from the public and from some of their employees. 
# DevSecOps
Set of practices and tools that intergrate and automate the work of software development, securitym and IT operations. Companies use it to limit friction between operations, security, and development concerns. It does however, require cross-functional teams, which means team members need to have a wide variety of skills and combinations of expertise that may be difficult to find.
# Communication Artifact
Can include dashboards, snapshots, presentations, press release, and any other tangible document that provides communication. Communication outcomes are what you hope will happen as a result of the communication you have sent. Communications goals build clarity in the process and allow you to design the appropriate amount of communication.
# EMV (Expected Monetary Value)
A way to calculate an average outcome in situations where there is uncertainty. To calculate the EMV, we need to know the probability an event will occur and the impact of the event on the overall cost. The probability and its monetary imapct are multiplied to reveal the EMV. The EMV is used to determine the contingency buffer needed for the project which is particularly helpful for large, expensive projects with many risks. 
# Operational Training
Part of the transition plan, which identifies how ongoing skill development will occur to ensure the continued use, maintenance, and improvement of the foundation laid by the project. 
# Low-severity issues
Do not affect functionality but should be resolved for branding, consistency, or an improved user experience. They are addresses within regularly scheduled releases.
