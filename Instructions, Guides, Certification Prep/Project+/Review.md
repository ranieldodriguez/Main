# Whiteboard:
collaboration tools that is the most effective for creating visual representations, brainstorming, and collectively discussing solutions
# Difference between Agile and Waterfall methodologies:
Waterfall follows a sequential and linear approach, progressing through distinct phases in a predifined order. 
Agile on the other hand, emphasizes iterative and incremental development, enabling flexibility and customer collaboraiton throughout the project.
# Simulation
Form of quantitive risk analysis that requires probability distributions for each outcome to make predictions. Detectability is a considerations in qualitive risk analysis. It measures how quickley a risk can be identified if it occurs.
# Qualitive Risk Anlysis
USes subjective criteria to anlayze and prioritize risks. It is faster and more intuitive thant quantitative risk analysis becuase it uses characteristics such as severity, likelyhood, and urgency and descriptors like high, medium, and low to catergorize and prioritize risks rather than mathematical formulas.
# Project Kick off Meeting
A live meeting that usually takes palce after the initiation phase of a project. The meeting brings together the project team members and helps to foster a shared understanding of the project.
# Burnup charts
Show the amount of work completed in the time period, with a line indicating the target for completed work. At the start of the project, the line begins at zero and ends at the total amount of work needed for completion. The progress is emasured toward the total, moving up as work is completed. Burnup charts work well for projects with a fixed scope and flexible timeline.
# Background screening
Operational security measure.
# Smoke Test
High-level system test that confirms that the main features of the software are working before detailed testing is conducted. It helps detect flawed builds early, saving time and effort.
# Qualitive Risk Analysis
Subjective approach to analyzing risk. It relies on individual preception and interpretation of risks, using basic scales to evaluate them. It serves as a preliminary step in risk management. Two main considerations in qualitative analysis are interconnectivity and detectability. Interconnectivity analyzes how risks may interact with one another, potentially causing a ripple effect. Detectability measures how quickly a risk can be identified if it occurs. High detectability risks offer clear signals, while low detectability risks may go unnoticed.
# Business Case
Argument for the project's existence. It should be compelling, appealing, and easy to read. It serves as the first project proposal and is completed during the planning phase.
# Units of Work
UOW result from the project being decomposed into small units, which can be completed in the sprint or other chosen work periods. They are defined during the planning phase. 
# Initial Risk Assessment
Is the first attempt to list and assess the events that may impact the project. It is completed in the planning phase.
# Agile-based methodologies
SAFe, XP, and Scrum are Agile methodologies
# Risk Exploitation
Involves taking steps to ensure that the event uccurs. It is the opposite of risk avoidance.
# Stakeholder ID
Determining who the stakeholders are is necessary for project managers as the first step in developing a stakeholder plan. Stakeholders include anyone who will be impacted by the project. Knowing who they are will help keep them up to date with progress, which helps reduce resitance to change. Determining who the stakehodlers are is done during the initiation phase. 
# Test Enviroment
a tier of software architecture where the beta version of the code is put before developers and even sample users to help find and resolve issues before launch.
# TOR
a type of SOW that focuses on the relationship that will develop between the customer and client. For this reason, TORs are commonly used to define the scope, expectations, and other details involved in delivering consultancy or research work.
# Client TOR (Terms of Reference)
Similar to SOW (Statement of Work), but often focuses on a relationship rather than the deliverables. TORs are common when dealing with consultants. 
# Facilitate the Transition
The third step in creating systemic Organizational Change Management (OCM). It should involve training and lots of support from within the company.
# SOW (Statement of Work)
Provides details about what work the vendor must complete. It defines the scope, sets expectations, and outlines technical requirements for the work. Vendors use the SOW to determine whether they can deliver the work. The SOW is produced early in the project and is included as part of the RFP (Request for Proposal). It is important that the SOW be clear, comprehensive, and concise. 
# Issue vs Defect
An issue is something that is outside of the team's control. A defect is a failure to meet the requirements. The failure can be remedied by either changing the product or changing the requirements.
# The options
A section that explores three to five potential solutions, providing advantages and disadvantages of each. Doing nothing should be only one option offered.
# Confidential data
Sensitive and should be seen only by authorized individuals whose jobs require the information. This can cinlude profit and loss statements and other information that a company might want to keep from the public and from some of their employees. 
# DevSecOps
Set of practices and tools that intergrate and automate the work of software development, securitym and IT operations. Companies use it to limit friction between operations, security, and development concerns. It does however, require cross-functional teams, which means team members need to have a wide variety of skills and combinations of expertise that may be difficult to find.
# Communication Artifact
Can include dashboards, snapshots, presentations, press release, and any other tangible document that provides communication. Communication outcomes are what you hope will happen as a result of the communication you have sent. Communications goals build clarity in the process and allow you to design the appropriate amount of communication.
# EMV (Expected Monetary Value)
A way to calculate an average outcome in situations where there is uncertainty. To calculate the EMV, we need to know the probability an event will occur and the impact of the event on the overall cost. The probability and its monetary imapct are multiplied to reveal the EMV. The EMV is used to determine the contingency buffer needed for the project which is particularly helpful for large, expensive projects with many risks. 
# Operational Training
Part of the transition plan, which identifies how ongoing skill development will occur to ensure the continued use, maintenance, and improvement of the foundation laid by the project. 
# Low-severity issues
Do not affect functionality but should be resolved for branding, consistency, or an improved user experience. They are addresses within regularly scheduled releases. 
# Governance
Address how the company is organized and meets the defintions of being a good citizen.
# Kanban
Agile technique that emphasizes visualizing the workflow and optimizing work processes. Through Kanban boards, it makes it easier for teams to track tasks, identify bottlenecks, and enhance collaboration and productivity. Kanabn uses a pull-based system, where work is brough into the workflow when there is capacity available which helps prevent overloading the team with work. Kanban specifically provides a visual for workflow management.
# JAD (Joint Application Development)
Specific type of workshop where customers take part in the design process of a product. A JAD workshop is a working session where the team and customer meet and design a product together. This is a good way to gain insights and support for the eventual product.
# Collaborating
Involves working together, sharing ideas, and utilizing expertise to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution. Necessitates active cooperation.
# Continuous Deployment 
Allows full automation of all processes so taht the code is released without manual checks. Comprehensive testing during intergrations and a strong recovery plan are needed so the code is less likely to have errors and any code that is released with errors can be withdrawn quickly.
# Risk Enhacement
Seeks to mazimize the positive impact of a risk. It is the opposite of risk mitigation.
# FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)
Risk analysis tool frequently used in manufacturing operations and prudct design. It involves a detailed analysis of a single process to identify multiple risks. FMEAs can proactively identify and eliminate design flaws during product and process design. 
# Communication Plan
Include goals, outcomes, channels, and artifacts. 
# Smoothing
Involves minimizing differences between conflicting parties and highlighting common interests to maintain team harmony.
# Execution Phase
During the execution phase, the work is done, and the team decides the outcomes have been met and the product can be delivered. 
# KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
Measure the most crucial aspects of a project, process, or organization. They include both the target and actual measures. The target is what is acceptable, while the actual is the measurement of performance.
# Business Case
The business case includes the executive summary, problem statement, options, and project defenition.
# ERP (Enterpise Resrouce Planning)
Helps manage operational workloads including accounting, supply chain activities, procurement processes, and resource management. ERP software helps companies efficiently acquire, manage, and consume resources. They help project managers by providing accurate and timely data for projects and by tracking finances, spending, and budgets. 
# Bottom Up Estimation
Begins with estimates of costs, duration, and other facets for each individual tasks or activities and adds them up for a total estiamtion. This is more accruate, but is also more time consuming way to estimate. It is best used when lots of information about the costs, duration, and other facets is known.
# Level Responsibility
Invovles having the apprpriate level fo detail for the work element. The appropriate level is determined by four factors; the team beleives they can complete the work with the given resources and time; the work will last between 8 - 80 hours; the work can be compeleted within the reporting period; the work results in a deliverable that can be measured; and breaking it down further wouldn't make the work easier or better.
# Scatter Diagram / Scatter Plot
Graphical representation of the relationship between two variables. It involves plotting two variables, one on the x-axis and one on the y-axis, and representing each occurance of the (x, y) variable with a dot. The diagram is useful in determining if there is a correlation between the variables. This can also help with root cause analysis.
# Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF)
A vendor is paid a fixed fee upfront for the work when the contract is signed. The additional fee is awarded based on the vendor's performance during the project. The buyer will evaluate the vendor's performance and award a bonus fee based on criteria such as time, quality, and innovation. The CPAF contract incentivises the vendor to meet the buyer's needs by offering a bonus fee if the vendor exceeds expectations.
