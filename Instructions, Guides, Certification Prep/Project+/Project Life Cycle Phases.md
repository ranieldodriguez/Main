# 2.0 Project Life Cycle Phases

The project life cycle phases provide a structured approach to managing projects from inception to completion. Each phase has specific activities, deliverables, and objectives that ensure the project progresses smoothly and achieves its goals

## 2.1 Discovery/Concept Preparation Phase

Explain the value of artifacts in the discovery/concept preparation phase for a project:

### Business Case or Business Objective:

- Return on Investment (ROI) Analysis: Helps in assessing the potential financial benefits of the project compared to its costs, ensuring the project is worth pursuing.
- Current State v Future State: Provides a clear understanding of the existing conditions and the desired outcomes, enabliung effective planning and goal settings.

### Prequalified Vendor:
Ensures that potential vendors have been evaluated and meet the necessary criteria, reducing risk and streamlining the procurement process.

### Predetermined Client: 
Identifies the primary client or stakeholder for the project, ensuring alignment with their expectations and requirements.

### Preexisting Contracts:

- Client SOW (Statement of Work): Outlines the project deliverables, scope, and responsibilities, providing a clear framework for execution
- Client TOR (Terms of Reference): Defines the objectives, scope, and deliverables of the project, ensuring all parties have a shared understanding.

### Financial Concepts:

- Capital Expenses (CapEx) vs. Opertational Expenses (OpEx): Differentiates between long-term investements (CapEx) and day-to-day operational costs (OpEx), aiding in budgeting and financial planning

## 2.2 Project Initiation Phase

Given a scenario, perform activities during the project initiation phase

### Develop the Project Charter

- Project Objectives: Define what the project aims to acheive
- Project Success Criteria: Establish metrics to measure the projects success
- Preliminary Scope Statement: Outline the projects scope to set boundries and expectations

### Identify and Assess Stakeholders:
Determine who will be affected bu the project and assess their needs and influence

### Develop a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM): 
RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed): Clarify roles and responsibilities to ensure accountability and efficient communication

### Establish Accepted Communication Channels:
Define how project information will be communicated to ensure clarity and consistency

### Develop a Records Management Plan:
- Data and Documents: Outline how project records will be handled, stored, and accessed

### Define Access Requirements: 
Specify who needs access to what informaiton to maintain security and efficiency

### Review Exisiting Artifacts:
Evaluate current documents and data to inform planning and execution

### Determine Solution Design:
Develop an initial design for the project solution to guide development

### Conduct Project Kickoff Methods: 
Initiate the project with a kickoff meetings to align the team and stakeholders

## 2.3 Project Planning Phase
Given a scenario, perform activities during the project planning phase

### Assess the Resource Pool:
Evaluate available resources and determine needs
- Preliminary Procurement Needs Assessment: Identify what needs to be procured to support the project.

### Assign Project Resources:
Allocate resources to tasks based on their skills and availability

### Train Project Team Members:
Ensure team members have the neccessary skills and knowledge

### Develop a Communication Plan: 
- Meeting Cadence and Methdologies: Establish how often and in what format meetings will be held.

### Develop a Detailed Scope Statement: 
Provide a comprehensive description of the project's scope

### Define Units of Work:
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): Break the project into manageable tasks
- Backlog: List tasks that need to be completed

### Develop a Project Schedule:
- Establish Cadences: Set timelines for tasks and milestones

### Determine Budget Considerations: 
Plan and allocate the project budget.

### Develop a QA Plan: 
Ensure quality standards are met throughout the project

### Perform an Initial Risk AssessmentL 
Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies

### Develop a transition plan/Release Plan:
- Operational Training, Go Live, Operational Handoff: Prepare for the transition to operation

### Develop a Project Management Plan:
- Establish Baselines and Milestones: Set benchmarks for measuring progress
- Establish Minimally Viable Product: Define the core deliverable to ensure project viability

## 2.4 Project Execution Phase
