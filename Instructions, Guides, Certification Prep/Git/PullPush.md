To pull a repository from GitHub to your local machine and push changes from your local machine back to GitHub, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Pulling a Repository from GitHub

#### Clone the Repository:
This will download a copy of the repository to your local machine.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
Replace `https://github.com/username/repository.git` with the URL of your repository.

#### Navigate to the Repository Directory:
After cloning, move into the repository directory.
```sh
cd repository
```

### Making Changes and Pushing to GitHub

#### Make Changes:
Make changes to the files in your repository using your preferred editor (e.g., VS Code).

#### Check the Status:
See what changes have been made.
```sh
git status
```

#### Add Changes:
Add the changes to the staging area.
```sh
git add .
```
This command stages all changes. If you want to stage specific files, replace `.` with the file names.

#### Commit Changes:
Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.
```sh
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

#### Push Changes:
Push the committed changes to the GitHub repository.
```sh
git push origin main
```
Replace `main` with the branch name if you are working on a different branch.

### Pulling Changes from GitHub to Local Repository

#### Fetch Changes:
This will update your local repository with changes from the remote repository without modifying your working directory.
```sh
git fetch
```

#### Merge Changes:
This will merge the fetched changes into your working directory.
```sh
git merge origin/main
```
Replace `main` with the branch name if you are working on a different branch.

#### Pull Changes:
You can also use the `git pull` command, which is a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`.
```sh
git pull origin main
```
Replace `main` with the branch name if you are working on a different branch.

2. Visual Studio will push your local commits to the GitHub repository automatically.

### Steps to Push Changes to GitHub Using VS Code

#### Open VS Code and Your Repository:
1. Make changes to your code:
   - Edit or add files in the repository as needed.

#### View Changes:
1. Click on the **Source Control** icon in the Activity Bar on the left side of the VS Code window (it looks like a branch icon).
2. You will see a list of changed files under the "Changes" section.

#### Stage Changes:
1. To stage all changes, click on the **+** icon next to "Changes."
2. To stage individual files, click on the **+** icon next to each file you want to stage.
3. Staged files will move from the "Changes" section to the "Staged Changes" section.

#### Commit Changes:

2. Click the checkmark icon (âœ“) above the message box to commit the staged changes.

#### Push Changes to GitHub:
1. After committing, you need to push the changes to GitHub.
2. Click on the three dots (ellipsis) at the top right corner of the Source Control panel to open the menu.
3. Select "Push" from the menu.
4. Alternatively, you can use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) and type "Git: Push" and select it.

### The results of your changes on GitHub after pushing from VS Code, follow these steps:

#### Open GitHub:
1. Go to GitHub and log in if you aren't already.

#### Navigate to Your Repository:
1. In the upper-right corner of the GitHub page, click on your profile icon.
2. Select "Your repositories" from the dropdown menu.
3. Click on the repository you just pushed your changes to.

#### View the Changes:
1. Once you are in your repository, you will see the main page of the repository, which typically displays the files and folders in the repository.
2. The most recent commit message should be displayed at the top of the file list.

#### Inspect Commits:
1. To see a list of all commits, click on the "Commits" link, which is usually found above the file list and below the repository name and description.
2. This will show you a history of all the commits, including your most recent one.
3. Click on the commit message to see the changes made in that commit.

#### Check Specific Files:
1. You can click on individual files in the repository to view their contents.
2. This will reflect the latest changes you pushed from VS Code.

### Steps to Pull Changes from GitHub to Your Local Repository

#### Open Terminal or Git CMD:
1. Open your terminal, Git CMD, or Git Bash.

#### Navigate to Your Local Repository:
1. Use the `cd` command to navigate to your local repository directory. For example:
```sh
cd path/to/your/repository
```

#### Fetch and Merge Changes:
1. Use `git pull` to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository into your local branch. This command combines `git fetch` and `git merge`.
```sh
git pull origin main
```
Replace `main` with the name of the branch you are working on if it's different.
