If you want to ensure that no one can accidentally or maliciously push changes to your main branch, you can set up branch protection rules.

Set Up Branch Protection Rules:
  Go to the Settings tab of your repository.
  Select Branches from the left sidebar.
  Click on Add rule under the Branch protection rules section.

Configure Branch Protection:
  Specify the branch name pattern (e.g., main or master).
  Check Require a pull request before merging.
  Optionally, you can also check:
  Require pull request reviews before merging
  Require status checks to pass before merging
  Restrict who can push to matching branches (Leave this unchecked if only you have write access, otherwise specify who can push)
  Click Create or Save changes.
